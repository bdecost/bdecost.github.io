I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher in [Prof. Liz Holm's group](https://holmgroup.github.io/about) in the [materials science department](https://materials.cmu.edu) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://cmu.edu). My main research focus is on applications of computer vision techniques for microstructure characterization.
