We present a new microstructure dataset consisting of ultrahigh carbon steel (UHCS) micrographs taken over a range of length scales under systematically varied heat treatments. Using the UHCS dataset as a case study, we develop a set of visualization tools for interacting with and exploring large microstructure and metadata datasets. Based on generic microstructure representations adapted from the field of computer vision, these tools enable image-based microstructure retrieval, as well as spatial maps of both microstructure and related metadata, such as processing conditions or properties measurements. We provide the microstructure image data, processing metadata, and source code for these microstructure exploration tools. The UHCS dataset is intended as a community resource for development and evaluation of microstructure data science techniques, and for creation of microstructure data science teaching modules.
