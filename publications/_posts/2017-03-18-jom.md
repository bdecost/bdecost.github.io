Using computer vision and machine learning methods, we develop a system to  characterize powder feedstock materials for metal additive manufacturing (AM).  Feature detection and description algorithms are applied to create a microstructural  scale image representation that can be used to cluster, compare, and analyze  powder micrographs. When applied to eight commercial feedstock powders, the  system classifies powder images into the correct material systems with greater than  95% accuracy. The system also identifies both representative and atypical powder  images. These results suggest the possibility of measuring variations in powders as  a function of processing history, relating microstructural features of powders to  properties relevant to their performance in AM processes, and defining objective  material standards based on visual images. A significant advantage of the computer  vision approach is that it is autonomous, objective, and repeatable.
