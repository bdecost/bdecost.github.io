I'm currently a [staff scientist at NIST](https://www.nist.gov/people/brian-decost) working on developing autonomous systems for materials synthesis, characterization, and modeling to support materials design and discovery.

I did my Ph.D. work with [Prof. Liz Holm](https://holmgroup.github.io/about) in the [materials science department](https://materials.cmu.edu) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://cmu.edu). My main research focus was on applications of computer vision techniques for microstructure characterization.
